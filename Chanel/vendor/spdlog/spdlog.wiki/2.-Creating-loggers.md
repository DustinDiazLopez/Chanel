Each logger contains a vector of one or more  ```std::shared_ptr<spdlog::sink>```.

On each log call (if the log level is right) the logger will call the ```sink(log_msg)``` function on each of them.

spdlog's sinks have `_mt` (multi threaded) or `_st` (single threaded) suffixes to indicate the thread safety.
While single threaded sinks cannot be used from multiple threads simultaneously they might be faster because no locking is employed.

### Creating loggers using the factory functions

```c++
//Create and return a shared_ptr to a multithreaded console logger.
#include "spdlog/sinks/stdout_color_sinks.h"
auto console = spdlog::stdout_color_mt("some_unique_name");
```
This will create a console logger, register it in spdlog's global registry with "some_unique_name" as its id, and return it as shared_ptr.

### Accessing loggers using spdlog::get("...")
Loggers can be accessed from anywhere using the thread safe ```spdlog::get("logger_name")``` which returns a shared pointer.


**Note**: ```spdlog::get``` might slow your code down since it locks a mutex, so use with caution. It is advisable to save the ```shared_ptr<spdlog::logger>``` returned and use it directly, at least in code hot paths.

A good approach would be to have a private member of type ```shared_ptr<spdlog::logger>``` which will be set in  the constructor:

```c++
class MyClass
{
private:
   std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> _logger;
public:
   MyClass()
   {
     //set _logger to some existing logger
     _logger = spdlog::get("some_logger");
     //or create directly
     //_logger = spdlog::rotating_file_logger_mt("my_logger", ...);
   }
};
```

**Note 2:** Manually created loggers (i.e. those you construct directly) do not get automatically registered and will not be found by the ```get("...")``` call.

If you want to register such logger use the ```register_logger(...)``` function:

```c++
spdlog::register_logger(my_logger);
...
auto the_same_logger = spdlog::get("mylogger");
```

### Create a rotating file logger
```c++
//Create rotating file multi-threaded logger
#include "spdlog/sinks/rotating_file_sink.h"
auto file_logger = spd::rotating_logger_mt("file_logger", "logs/mylogfile", 1048576 * 5, 3);
...
auto same_logger= spdlog::get("file_logger");
```

### Creating asynchronous loggers
```c++
#include "spdlog/async.h"
void async_example()
{
    // default thread pool settings can be modified *before* creating the async logger:
    // spdlog::init_thread_pool(8192, 1); // queue with 8k items and 1 backing thread.
    auto async_file = spdlog::basic_logger_mt<spdlog::async_factory>("async_file_logger", "logs/async_log.txt");
    // alternatively:
    // auto async_file = spdlog::create_async<spdlog::sinks::basic_file_sink_mt>("async_file_logger", "logs/async_log.txt");
   
}
```
For asynchronous logging, spdlog uses a shared global thread pool with a dedicated message queue.

For this, it creates fixed number of **pre-allocated slots** in the message queue (~256 bytes per slot in 64 bits) and can be modified using ```spdlog::init_thread_pool(queue_size, backing_threads_count)```

When trying to log a message and the queue is full, the caller will block (default behavior) until a slot becomes available (default), or overrun oldest message immediately in the queue with the new one (if the logger was constructed with ```async_overflow_policy==overrun_oldest```).  

### Creating loggers manually 
```c++
auto sink = std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::stdout_sink_mt>();
auto my_logger= std::make_shared<spdlog::logger>("mylogger", sink);
```

### Creating loggers with multiple sinks
```c++
std::vector<spdlog::sink_ptr> sinks;
sinks.push_back(std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::stdout_sink_st>());
sinks.push_back(std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::daily_file_sink_st>("logfile", 23, 59));
auto combined_logger = std::make_shared<spdlog::logger>("name", begin(sinks), end(sinks));
//register it if you need to access it globally
spdlog::register_logger(combined_logger);
```

### Creating multiple file loggers with the same output file
If you want to have different loggers to write to the same output file all of them must share the same sink. Otherwise you might get strange results. 
```c++
auto sharedFileSink = std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::basic_file_sink_mt>("fileName.txt");
auto firstLogger = std::make_shared<spdlog::logger>("firstLoggerName", sharedFileSink);
auto secondLogger = std::make_unique<spdlog::logger>("secondLoggerName", sharedFileSink);
```
